Several CRG FM voice repeaters are connected to the AllStarLink network.

This allows us to link repeaters around the area, and allow access to wider-area reflectors.

Here's some common commands you can send using DTMF tones:
- \*52: Parrot (any audio in the same transmission as you send \*52 will be played back to you)
- \*53: Connect to Hubnet
- \*55: Connect GB3PE to GB3PI
- \*57: Connect to GB3NZ (Norwich)
- \*58: Connect to GB3EI (North Uist, Scotland)
- \*73: Disconnect all links
